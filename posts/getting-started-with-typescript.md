**TypeScript** is a strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript, giving you better tooling at any scale.

# What is TypeScript?

### JavaScript and More
TypeScript adds additional syntax to JavaScript to support a tighter integration with your editor. Catch errors early in your editor.

### A Result You Can Trust
TypeScript code converts to JavaScript, which runs anywhere JavaScript runs: In a browser, on Node.js or Deno and in your apps.

### Safety at Scale
TypeScript understands JavaScript and uses type inference to give you great tooling without additional code.

# Adopt TypeScript Gradually
JavaScript file
Apply types to your JavaScript project incrementally, each step improves editor support and improves your codebase.

Let's take this incorrect JavaScript code, and see how TypeScript can catch mistakes in your editor.
